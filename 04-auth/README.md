# 04-auth

- This app basically focuses on authentication. Firebase is used as a bakcend.
- Key concepts includes:
  - How to authenticate
  - Switching screens based on whether authenticated or not (check App.js)
  - Storing data "locally" (similar to localStorage in web development) Note: at the moment, the course is outdated. But the concept is similar. (https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage) AsyncStorage is depreceated and we should use one of these instead: https://reactnative.directory/?search=storage (check auth-context.js)
